Fasicnated by the technical subjects, by the time I graduated I knew little about the industry I was to join. I was naÃ¯ve, had all the technical knowledge and no clue what to expect. Two jobs and a pandemic later I find myself looking to make drastic changes to my life, driven by a desire to be challenged and rewarded. 

As a dependable and pragmatic fast learner, I am a confident person who thrives in challenging roles. Problem solving is what I love and do best. Having felt stagnant, unrewarded and unchallenged as a mechanical engineer; I feel there is no better industry for me than software. It is dynamic, rewarding and exiting - I think of it like a frontier of human innovation, and I intend to find myself there.

## Software Projects

| Name                         | Description       | Tech/tools        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Student - Directory**      | Interactive program to manage the student lsit of Villains Acedemy | Ruby,             |
| **Fizzbuzz**                 | Simple program that outputs different phrases dependant on integer input  | Ruby, Rspec       |

## Skills

> - **Self Starter** - Starting a new engineering role during lockdown, I was unable to undergo training and therefore unable to design the heavily regulated products. With my job in jepeardy I had to prove myself. A year on I had carved myself a new research/desinger role where I dealt with all manner of novel problems (where nobody had any experience) and proved myself invalubale, performing many techincal analysis and design tasks. ***link here*** 
> - **Adaptable** - Whether tackling new concepts or familiar problems, I approach everything with the same pragmatism and logic seen throughout my career. 
> - **Team Player** - Knowing when to take a leadership role, be a motivator or to just ensure you pull your weight - is a well honed skill of mine. Team working is has been a vital part of my life for as long as I can rememeber, not just in acedemically or professionally, but in the lifestyle and hobbies I choose. 
> - **Attenion To Detail** - Having worked in an industry where products are designed to within 1/1000th of millimetre and the slightest miscalculation could cause serious injury or worse, attention to detail is not something I could have survived without.

## Interests

- Computers! Originally spured on by simply having a PC inadequate to play the games I was bought. I found myself learning everything I could about computer         hardware. Obsessed with specs, I knew every hardware initialism on the market. Eventually after years of nagging/begging I was allowed to built my own computer from scratch     for my gaming exploits. It was probably one of the first SLI dual GPU machines around and I still have it now, 15 years on.

- Mountain Sports. I began attending Scouts from age 9 and finished at 16. In that time, I had the privilege of
  accompanying my scout troop on countless trips and expeditions domestically and internationally; to places
  such as Wales, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and the USA. The highlight of which, in 2008, was a month-long
  trip to Alaska involving a week long expedition up mount Flower, an equally long canoeing trip down the
  Matanuska River and numerous other excursions partaking in outdoors activities. The whole experience
  provided invaluable teamworking, resilience and survival experience which was influential on me from a
  young age.

- I am hugely interested in Physics and Astronomy. Since a young age I was always inquisitive about the nature
  of things; I became absolutely fascinated with physics, which was pivotal in my progression towards
  engineering. I have read some of the most popular, and some more niche, books spanning space, astronomy
  and theoretical & particle physics.

- I am an avid mountain biker. I will be out riding my bike almost every weekend.

- Rugby is a sport in which I am very passionate. Having played from ages 7 to 20, for Sunday Club, school and
  University, I follow most international & top league fixtures and regularly attend games at Twickenham.

- Music has always been something I am very passionate about. I began playing the piano aged 7 and finished
  my grade 7 exams aged 17. Aside from playing music, I regularly attend music festivals and gigs with my friends
