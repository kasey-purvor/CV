## Kasey Purvor
Mechanical Engineer highly motivated to break into software role. 

Due to the straightforward progression from degree to industry, by the time I graduated I knew very little about the industry I was about to join. I was naïve, had all the technical knowledge and no clue what to expect. Several years, 2 jobs and a pandemic later I find myself looking to make drastic changes to my life - driven by a desire to be challenged and rewarded. 

As a dependable and pragmatic fast learner, I am a confident person who thrives in challenging roles. My problem solving has been well demonstrated throughout my academic and professional career, this is what I love and do best. Having felt slightly stagnant, unrewarded and unchallenged as a mechanical engineer - I feel there is no better industry for me than software. To me the industry is the most stimulating, where anybody can create almost anything with little more than a laptop. I think of it like a frontier of human innovation, where all the newest most exiting creations are based.

In my opinion, for a career, you will not find a more new, fast paced, dynamic, far reaching or rewarding industry. It really is the frontier of human innovation and technology and I intend to find myself there.

## Skills

#### Self-Starter 

With particular reference to problems that begin from a place of no/little relevant knowledge - I actively seek out these tasks. During my employmnt at Servotest, as a newcomer during the pandemic, I was unable to be tutored through the information heavy design processs. I carved myself a role that almost exclusively delt in problems that had not been encountered before - as nobody was better suited to them through experience. Designing ballistic safety screens to protect users from projectiled hydraulic equippment involved many new subjects: Health & saftey regulations for pressure systems, ballistic properties of tranluscent materials, identifying potential projectiles (as hydraulic components unfamiliar to me), projectile acceleration resulting from fluid pressure escape and impact mechanics - to name a few. The final product can be seen here(link to follow) and the calculations and theory behind the design can be viewed here( link coming). The relavent materials can be veiwed here. (link to follow).
Additional projects can be seen here (link to follow) 


#### Team Work 

Team workiung is something I have demonstrated thoughout my life, not just in acedemia or profesionally but in the hobbies and activities I persue. A good demonstration of this was during my final year group design and make project, which I undertook with 3 others. OVer the course of 12 months the 4 of us set out to research, design and make a plasma surface modification machine. It had a plethora of moving parts; the research witch took nealy 9 months, the design work whcih began before the research was finished, the safety reviews and procedures (some of us recieved compressed gas training), the financial aproval (as the microwave amplifyer cost over £20000) and the requisition of all parts. THe project tested me and the teams abilities nearly to breaking point. In the end we succeded, project can be viewed here (link to follow) 


## Interests

- Computers! Originally spured on by simply having a PC that was not fast enough to play the games I was bought. I found myself learning everything I could about computer         hardware. Obsessed with specs, I knew every hardware initialism on the market. Eventually after years of nagging/begging I was allowed to built my own computer from scratch     for my gaming exploits. It was probably one of the first SLI dual GPU machines around and I still have it now, 15 years on.

- Mountain Sports. I began attending Scouts from age 9 and finished at 16. In that time, I had the privilege of
  accompanying my scout troop on countless trips and expeditions domestically and internationally; to places
  such as Wales, Canada, Switzerland, Norway and the USA. The highlight of which, in 2008, was a month-long
  trip to Alaska involving a week long expedition up mount Flower, an equally long canoeing trip down the
  Matanuska River and numerous other excursions partaking in outdoors activities. The whole experience
  provided invaluable teamworking, resilience and survival experience which was influential on me from a
  young age.

- I am hugely interested in Physics and Astronomy. Since a young age I was always inquisitive about the nature
  of things; I became absolutely fascinated with physics, which was pivotal in my progression towards
  engineering. I have read some of the most popular, and some more niche, books spanning space, astronomy
  and theoretical & particle physics.

- I am an avid mountain biker. I will be out riding my bike almost every weekend.

- Rugby is a sport in which I am very passionate. Having played from ages 7 to 20, for Sunday Club, school and
  University, I follow most international & top league fixtures and regularly attend games at Twickenham.

- Music has always been something I am very passionate about. I began playing the piano aged 7 and finished
  my grade 7 exams aged 17. Aside from playing music, I regularly attend music festivals and gigs with my
  friends
